# Bridge-Finding-Robots

<h1> The Problem (credit: Gr. 12 CS class)</h1>
<p>Problem: Let's say you were a robot trying to find a bridge in a dark forest at night. You can only see a tiny bit ahead of you, and you know that the bridge is either straight east or straight west relative to your current position.</p>

<p>How do you go about finding the bridge? Here are two ways.</p>

<h21> Way 1: Constant growth in both directions </h1>
